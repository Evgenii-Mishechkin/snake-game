      <p>Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains the personal data our website processes, how our website processes it, and for what purposes.</p>
      
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users. We collect information in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Information you give us:</strong> For example, our website requires you to sign up for an account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card.</li>
        <li><strong>Information we get from your use of our services:</strong> We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect from all our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect our website and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.</p>
      
      <h2>Information We Share</h2>
      <p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of our website unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With your consent:</strong> We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of our website when we have your consent to do so.</li>
        <li><strong>For external processing:</strong> We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>
        <li><strong>For legal reasons:</strong> We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of our website if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
          <ul>
            <li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</li>
            <li>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>
            <li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>
            <li>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of our website, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Information Security</h2>
      <p>We work hard to protect our website and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We encrypt many of our services using SSL.</li>
        <li>We offer you two-step verification when you access your account.</li>
        <li>We restrict access to personal information to our employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes).</p>
